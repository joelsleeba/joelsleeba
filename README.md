Hi, I'm Joel Sleeba. I am a graduate student in IISER Thiruvananthapuram. Right now I am studying Fourier analysis for my master's project. Thanks to [it@school](https://kite.kerala.gov.in), I was introduced to Ubuntu 10.04 operating system in my school. In a few years I started my migration from windows to Linux. Although Linux operating systems didn't have that sleek GUI back then, the fact that I wouldn't be annoyed by Cortana, and the frequent windows updates that break my system made me stick with Linux. Now I'm using Manjaro as my daily operating system. I'm soon planning to shift to the holy 'Arch' once I'm done with my master's project. I'm using [NeoVim](neovim.org) in [LunarVim](lunarvim.org) config as text editor. You will be able to find my configs in the repo [dotfiles](github.com/joelsleeba/dotfiles).

I have a blog I sometimes write or share a few pictures on. You can visit it [here](joelsleeba.github.io/blog).
Also there is this series of webpages I created when I was learning CSS. I still use google to center stuff, but I think that project is cool. You can checkout that in [CSSArt](joelsleeba.github.io/CSSart). 
And that's something about me. If you want to know more, feel free to write to me. You'll find me email [here](joelsleeba.github.io). You might find me on Instagram, but I'm not very active there _(Let's say, I want to be a good boy and stay away from distractions)_.
